    - `python_class_identity_matrix` [hyperlink within this MD document]
    - `another_derivative_class` [hyperlink within this MD document]

## Features
The key features of the `python_package_matrix`:
- Matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication:
    - `Example code`
- Determinant and inverse calculation
    - `Example code`
- Support for special matrices (identity, zero matrix, etc.)
    - `Example code`
